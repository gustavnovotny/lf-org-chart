============

Lf-org-chart is a plugin for Liferay 6.0.6. It adds a new portlet (Organization Chart) which displays hierarchy of communities, organizations, user groups, teams and users as a tree. 

Lf-org-chart uses jQuery (http://jquery.com/) and jsTree (http://www.jstree.com/) to render the tree and icons from http://pc.de/icons/ to make it look better.

To install the plugin copy dist/lf-org-chart.war to deploy dir of your Liferay installation. You can also build lf-org-chart from sources - simply run:
