lf-org-chart
============

Lf-org-chart is a plugin for Liferay 6.0.6. It adds a new portlet (lf-org-chart) which displays hierarchy of communities, organisations, user groups, teams and users as a tree. 

Lf-org-chart uses jQuery (http://jquery.com/) and jsTree (http://www.jstree.com/) to render the tree and icons from http://pc.de/icons/ to make it look better.

To build and install the plugin simply run:

```
mvn clean package
```

and copy lf-org-chart.war to deploy dir of your Liferay installation.
